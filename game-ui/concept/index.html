    <h2>Description & UI Components</h2>
    <p>My game is a bird feeder game. In the beginning, the player starts out with a simple bird feeder and bird seeds.
        The birds that visit the player's feeder(s) leave the in-game currency called doodads. Players can use doodads
        at the shop to buy better feeders and seeds to attract higher level birds that leave more doodads. They can also
        use doodads to buy more spots for feeders in their yard.</p>

    <p>Some challenges the players might face include: predators (squirrels, cats, etc.), bad weather, environmental
        changes, and time and resource management. The main goals of the bird feeder game is to attract birds and
        maintain the feeders.</p>

    <p>UI Components: clock, weather indicator (indicates types of weather: stormy, clear, cold, etc.), inventory
        (houses different feeders and seeds), feeder level indicator (how much food is left), doodad tracker, shop, bird
        book (keeps track of bird visitors), threat indicator (indicates if a predator is near)</p>

    <p>I intend to make the clock, weather indicator, inventory, feeder level indicator, and doodad tracker. If I have
        extra time, I'll tackle other aspects like the shop, bird book, and threat indicator.</p>
